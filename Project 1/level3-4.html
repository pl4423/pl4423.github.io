		<h1> Ray Punzel </h1>
		<div class="stanza1"> 
			<p>
			A man named Ray Punzel<br>
			Was feeling quite sour<br>
			Because he'd locked himself in<br>
			The top room of his tower<br>
			With no electricity<br>
			And no form of power<br>
			Not so much as a mirror<br>
			A sink or a shower<br>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="stanza2"> 
			<p>
			Poor old Ray Punzel<br>
			Lived all alone<br>
			Far away from anyone<br>
			He did not have a phone<br>
			And after a day<br>
			He started to moan<br>
			To a bird who had perched<br>
			On his windowsill of stone<br>
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="stanza3"> 
			<p>
			The bird watched his beard grow<br>
			While he grumbled and groaned<br>
			</p>
			<p> 
			For many long years<br>
			He felt hunger and pain<br>
			The bird brought him worms<br>
			And when it rained he drank rain<br>
			His waistline receded<br>
			And he went quite insane<br>
			While his beard kept on growing<br>
			To the length of a train<br>
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="stanza4" 
			<p>
			But a plan to save Ray<br>
			Had formed inside the bird's brain<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			The bird disappeared<br>
			For almost a week<br>
			Which made Ray more sad<br>
			More hopeless and bleak<br>
			But to his surprise<br>
			When he was feeling most weak<br>
			A noise came to his ears -<br>
			He heard someone speak!<br>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="stanza5">
			<p>
			And Ray was so happy<br>
			A tear ran down his cheek<br>
			 </p><p>
			Outside in the distance<br>
			A man had appeared<br>
			With the bird on his shoulder<br>
			Ray's window he neared<br>
			“Ray Punzel, Ray Punzel<br>
			Let down your long beard<br>
			A little bird tells me<br>
			You've been stuck there for years”<br>
			</p>
		</div>


		<div class="stanza6">
			<p>
			If Ray hadn't forgotten how<br>
			He would have cheered<br>
			</p> <p>
			Ray gathered his beard<br>
			Which now filled his lair<br>
			He threw it out of the window<br>
			And it fell through the air<br>
			It hit the ground with a thud<br>
			And made the mystery man stare<br>
			Who then climbed up Ray's whiskers<br>
			Instead of using the stairs<br>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="stanza7">
			<p>
			He was shocked when he saw<br>
			Ray's room was so bare<br>
			</p> <p>
			The bird he had found<br>
			A locksmith by trade<br>
			Who opened Ray's door<br>
			Which was sturdily made<br>
			And Ray ran down the stairs<br>
			And into the glade<br>
			And as he jumped up for joy<br>
			His good mood did fade<br>
 			</p><p>
			Because a key<br>
			Fell right out of<br>
			His pocket.
