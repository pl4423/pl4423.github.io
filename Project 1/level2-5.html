<h6>Ray Punzel</h6>

	<h6>A man named Ray Punze
	Was feeling quite sour
	Because he'd locked himself in
	The top room of his tower
	And no form of power
	Not so much as a mirror
A sink or a shower
	And he was there for much longer
	Than minutes and hours</h6>

<h5>Poor old Ray Punzel
Lived all alone
Far away from anyone
He did not have a phone
And after a day
He started to moan
To a bird who had perched
On his windowsill of stone
The bird watched his beard grow
While he grumbled and groaned</h5>
</p>
<p> 
<h4>For many long years
He felt hunger and pain
The bird brought him worm
And when it rained he drank rain
His waistline receded
And he went quite insane
While his beard kept on growing
To the length of a train
But a plan to save Ray
Had formed inside the bird's brain</h4>

<h3>
The bird disappeared
For almost a week
Which made Ray more sad
More hopeless and bleak
But to his surprise
When he was feeling most weak
A noise came to his ears -
He heard someone speak!

And Ray was so happy
A tear ran down his cheek
</h3><h2>
Outside in the distance
A man had appeared
With the bird on his shoulder
Ray's window he neared
“Ray Punzel, Ray Punzel
Let down your long beard
A little bird tells me
You've been stuck there for years”
<br>
If Ray hadn't forgotten how
He would have cheered
</h2><h1>
Ray gathered his beard
Which now filled his lair
He threw it out of the window
And it fell through the air
It hit the ground with a thud
And made the mystery man stare
Who then climbed up Ray's whiskers
Instead of using the stairs
He was shocked when he saw
Ray's room was so bare
<h1><br>
The bird he had found<br>
A locksmith by trade<br>
Who opened Ray's door<br>
Which was sturdily made<br>
And Ray ran down the stairs<br>
And into the glade<br>
And as he jumped up for joy<br>
His good mood did fade<br>
 </p><p><h6>
Because a key<br>
Fell right out of<br>
His pocket.</h6>
